  caveats <<~EOS
    Wick is not notarized, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    Open System Settings → Privacy & Security, click Open Anyway, then Open.
    On macOS 12–14, Control-click Wick in Applications → Open also works.
    The wick command (wick status, wick start 45) runs once Wick has opened.
